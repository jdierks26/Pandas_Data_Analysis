Data Cleaning and Analysis Using Pandas

Here is a quick guide to my project in case you would like to jump to certain skills or sections

    The dataset I will be using for this project consists of used car sales and any pertinent information
    that might influence the car's sale price

    The variables: ['name', 'year', 'selling_price', 'km_driven', 'fuel', 'seller_type', 'transmission', 'owner',
    'mileage', 'engine', 'max_power', 'torque', 'seats'],

File 1: 'Dirtying' the Dataset--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In this file I would like to create artificial problems that one might come across while importing and cleaning
    data, since this dataset is 'tidy' and without problem

    -Goal 1: Create a problem where a column's values are stored inside multiple columns, instead of one neat column

    -Goal 2: Create a problem where 2 variables are stored into one column

    -Goal 3: Create a problem where a column is recorded inconsistently

    -Goal 4: Split the dataset into 2 csv files

File 2: 'Cleaning' the Dataset--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In this file I would like to emulate a rudimentary data cleaning process that solves the problems I created, then
    prepares the data for analysis

    -Goal 1: Merge the two csv files

    -Goal 2: Fix the problem where multiple column headers are values, not variables

    -Goal 3: Fix the problem where 2 variables are stored into one column

    -Goal 4: Fix the problem where a column is recorded inconsistently

    -Goal 5: Perform various data manipulation techniques, such as applying functions, filtering, sorting, etc.

File 3: Analysis----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this file I would like to ask questions about this dataset and see if we can predict the car's sale price

-Question 1: What is the relationship, if any, between the car's sale price and its mileage?
    - How does this relationship change with year?
    - How does this relationship change with the number of owners?
    - How does this relationship change with a different seller type?
